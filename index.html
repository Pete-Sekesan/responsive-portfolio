                        <p>
                            I am 36 years old and live in New York. I just wanted to take this time to introduce myself. As I progress in my course and professional experience, I will use this site to keep everything current to showcase my skills for prospective employers.

                            <p>
                                I am truly excited to be taking on this challenge of becoming a developer. It is something that has been a great interest to me for quite some time, and to have the opportunity to see it through is something I am embracing fully.

                        <h2> About Me</h2>
                        <p>
                            After spending almost 10 years in the Events Marketing industry, I was, along with many others left unemployed due to the effects of Covid-19 on the economy. I used this time to reflect and recalibrate on what I wanted to do with my career going forward.
                            After making the decision to enroll in Thinkfuls Full-Stack Developer Program, the prospect of being able to enter this field and work along some expert programmers is now a reality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I am not coding, exercising takes up my free time. In addition to chasing around a toddler, I am an avid runner and have completed to date 3 marathons and over 10 halfs. I also love to travel (you know, when that becomes a thing again). The excitement
                            of traveling to new places and seeing new cultures is something that never gets old. Always having the desire to learn, both in life and professionally is a driving force in my life. I am also a huge fan of Disney.

                            This is a little project I have wanted to make that randomly assigns the entered names to who they will getting gifts for that year. The participants will enter their emails and will have an email generated to them to disclose who they will have for that
