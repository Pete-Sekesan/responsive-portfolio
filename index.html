                <h3>Hi, I'm Pete Sekesan!</h3>
                <p>
                    I just wanted to take this time to introduce myself. As I progress in my course and professional experience, I will use this site to keep everything current to showcase my skills for prospective employers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am truly excited to be taking on this challenge of becoming a developer. It is something that has been a great interest to me for quite some time, and to have the opportunity to see it through is something I am embracing fully.
                </p>
